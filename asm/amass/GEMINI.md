# Project: Amass Data Analysis 

## General Instructions
- Focus on JSON data file, these usually have a suffix of .log these are the outputs of Amass
- Do not read the entire file unless explicitely prompted to 
- Search amass documentation online if you need help
- When reporting on sessions, mirror the structure you see there: note the organization, domain(s), log timestamp, total vs live target counts, and any highlighted discoveries (DNS TXT records, ASN mapping, WHOIS/name server details, etc.).

## Tool Generation
- Create Python or Bash scripts if you need to to perform data analysis
- Do NOT delete the tools so I can reuse them in the future
